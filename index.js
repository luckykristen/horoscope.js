    The attention is flattering, to be sure, but you're unlikely to have any desire to pursue the relationship. 
    You're happy with what you have right now. And as they say, "If it ain't broke, don't fix it."`);

    It isn't so much that you're embracing any particular religion, more that you're quite curious about the supernatural and some of the ancient arts. 
    Take some time today to visit the library or bookstore and do some reading on the subject. 
    You might want to form a study group with other like-minded individuals.`);

    Before you know it, the two of you could be winging your way to exotic lands.`);
